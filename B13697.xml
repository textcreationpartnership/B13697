            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had commonly serued at their tables, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other their seuerall and sumptuous seruices, the skull of a dead man, to the end, in the middest of their delicates, to be put in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their death. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> commanded his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine euery morning thus to round him in the eare, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou art a mortall man.</hi> This was such a note in <hi>Hieroms</hi> Meditations, as me thinke, so often as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his speech, I thinke of the Nightingale, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing got a note that likes her well, delighteth in the
<pb facs="tcp:177635:16"/> often trebling &amp; quauering of it. <hi>Whether</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I sleepe, or whether I wake, or whatsoeuer else I doe, me think I heare this voice alwaies soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in my eares, Arise yee dead, and come vnto iudgment.</hi> I reade of an ancient Father that should say, that all his study lay in a booke of three leaues, the red leafe of Christs Passion, the white leafe of the blessed Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Saints, the black leafe of the blacknesse of darknesse for euer, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the damned. The often cogitation of death, cannot but reduce to our mindes the three leaues of this booke; and the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereof cannot but be as a Manuel vnto vs of melliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:177635:17"/> meditations. There is nothing so effectuall to put an end to sin, as the deuout consideration of the end without end. But an end of this, because I speak at large to you of it in my Treatise following. It remaineth that I giue hearty thankes to you both, for the great kindnesse you haue shewed me in my natiue Citie, vnto which I was called a Preacher in the chiefe Parish thereof, not seeking it, nor once thought of it, whereunto I came chiefly for your sakes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sensible experience of your long continued loues towards me. During which time of my abode now for six yeares, I haue been much recreated by the
<pb facs="tcp:177635:17"/> pietie, humanitie, hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, societie; as hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to gratifie you withall, than this paper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the pledge of my vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deuotion to you both. Thus praying to God for a blessing vpon it and you, I commit you to the gratious protection of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who shall build further, and giue you an inheritance among them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through faith.</p>

                  <hi>Thine end is come.</hi> I cannot better expresse this subiect ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, than by this apologue or similitude: A man walketh by the way, and falleth into a deepe pit, full of noysome and venomous creatures: in his fall, he taketh hold of the branch of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177635:35"/> a tree at the pits brinke, and hangeth thereby: afterward comes a leane and hunger-star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued beast, which gnaweth and eateth asunder the bough. The morall is this: This pilgrime is the person impenitent; the pit is hell; the branch of the tree, is the frailtie of this life; and this leane and greedie beast that deuoureth him, is Death.</p>

                  <hi>It is an excellent thing to learne death in death,</hi> saith <hi>Seneca.</hi> Whereas death is vncertaine, and the time thereof in it selfe so vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; we ought to be prouided and reckon euerie day the last. The Buzzard in the Bible crowed ouer his corne-heapes, as the Cocke vpon his dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, in the view of his plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouision, made for many yeeres to come: but hee was found to bee a foole, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent shewed it, his soule the same night being taken away from him. Men care too much for life that is vncertaine, and too little for death that is most certaine. If the King, in his gracious goodnesse towards thee, should bee pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a good office vpon thee,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177635:37"/> and should restraine thee to the short space of an houre, for the ingrossing and consignation of the grant, wouldest thou not giue all diligence to dispatch it with all speed? Now a greater grant is made to vs, of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> by the King of Kings, and meerely out of his free fauour towards vs, and now is the time or neuer, of assuring it vnto vs, and it is but short, and as vncertaine as wee see. Wherefore bee wee carefull to make our election sure, in these dayes of our pilgrimage vpon earth. If to acquire a temporall benefit, thou canst bee content to expell sleepe, to forbeare meat and drinke, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue thy selfe of thy delights, that so thou mightest not lose the occasion offered: buckle thy selfe to thy deuotions in time, and make h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177635:37"/> present grace ministred, to put off the worke of thy saluation from day to day, as <hi>Festus</hi> did <hi>Paul;</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> or till we haue fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed our fathers funerals, with him that would fawne and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after Christ, noted in the Gospell. Regard not so much a long life as a good. Rather couet to liue well than long. It is dangerous to liue in that estate, in which thou wouldest be loth to die. Wherefore it shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe thee to looke to thy life, in respect of the vncertaintie of the houre of death. It was fatherly indulgence on Gods side towards vs, that our death should bee vncertaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to vs. The vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our dissolution, preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth dissolution; and taketh bond of vs for resolution in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For were we assured of life, we would liue out at length without remorse in our sinfull
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:177635:38"/> proceedings. But this vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of life casteth a boll of water vpon our hot bloud, and is a bridle to our sinnes, and a principall spurre to pricke vs on to all manner duties of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Againe, did a man know that his death should bee sudden, the scantnesse of the time would bee apt to beget a scant repentance. And if the time were long ere wee should depart, I feare it would be long ere wee would conuert: both which are ominous, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend perill. Moreouer, the Lord detaineth the knowledge of life from thee, for thy neighbours good. Now the common good is in it selfe greater than the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate. If thou couldest tell that thou shouldest die soone, many good deeds tending to deuotiō, &amp; to the common good, would be left vndone. How many be there, who lying sicke in their beds, doe seriously turne vnto
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177635:38"/> God, for they haue no hope of their recouerie: who, were they ascertained of their health to be renued, would turne copie, and sing another song. Finally, if thou couldest foresee the time of thy visitation, that is yet a farre off, thou wouldest runne with the prodigall sonne into a farre Countrey, farre from thy fathers house, thou wouldest pursue thy vindicatiue affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and there would bee no peace within thy wals. And if wee could foresee our death to be at hand, wee would bee sad, melancholike, froward, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to all about vs: all which vnioynt peace, and are aduerse to humane conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore for this benefit we giue God thankes, we mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and adore his most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the kindes of Death.</head>
               <p>THere bee two kindes of death, as there be of life, in nature answerable each to other. 1. <hi>Corporall.</hi> 2. <hi>Spirituall. Corporall</hi> death is nothing else, but the diuorse of soule and body: as bodily life is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of them both. This bodily death in holy writ, is called the <hi>first Death,</hi> because in time it goes before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Spirituall death is the separation of the whole man, both in body and soule, from the fellowship with God. Of these twaine, the <hi>first</hi> is but an entrance to death: the <hi>second</hi> is the absolute accomplishment thereof. For as the soule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s the life of the body, so is God the life of the soule, and his spirit is the soule of our soule.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:177635:40"/>
               <p>This <hi>spirituall Death</hi> hath three distinct degrees. 1. The first is when a man is dead in sinne while he liueth. And this is the degree the Apostle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, where he saith,<note n="q" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6.</note>
                  <hi>But shee that liueth in pleasure is dead while she liueth.</hi> And thus it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with vs all by nature,<note n="r" place="margin">Ephes. 2.1.</note>
                  <hi>who are dead in sinnes and trespasses.</hi> 2. The second degree is the end of this life, when the body embraceth the earth, <hi>Free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead:</hi> and the soule goeth downe to hell. 3. The third degree is the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the body and the soule vnited againe shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to damnation.</p>
               <p>Of the two deaths, the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> is the worser. The bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death is terrible to nature: but the horror of the second is not to be expressed. For it is the curse of all curses, the misery of all miseries. The toothach, the headach, the collicke and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177635:40"/> stone, are oftentimes so sharp and vehement, as the Pati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t wisheth he were dead. Now if these fits can so much distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per minde and body, as all the pleasures of this life cannot qualifie them; what manner of torment shall that bee, when not one kinde of paine, but the whole viall of Gods wrath shall be powred out, not vpon one member, but on the whole soule, body, and conscience: and not for a time, vnder hope of a better condition, but for time, and times, and when there shall bee no more time; and that not in this world, where there are comforts, helps, and remedies; but in that vile and darksome place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and that not amongst liuing men, which might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ease thy paine, or pity thy case, but with the deuills and damned ghosts, which will laugh at thy destruction, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:177635:41"/> solace themselues amidst all thy miseries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how shall I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the second death? that would I faine know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By turning a new leafe, in turning to God, by affiance in the merits of Christs death and passion, keeping faith and a good conscience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end. Who so doth these things, shall not die for euer.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of our necessary preparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the time of death.</head>
               <p>IN respect of the certainty of death, of the vncertainty of the time, and of the kindes of death, hitherto treatized of; it is more than necessary that wee be prepared against it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. Of this preparation I see there be two sorts. 1. <hi>A Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> 2. <hi>A Particular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Generall I call that, which is in action all our life time. If any should reply, what need so much adoe, holding it sufficient to enter this course, when we draw nearer our latter end? I answer, It must without delay be presently performed.<note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 3.7.</note>
                  <hi>To day if ye will heare his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 3.13.</note>
                  <hi>Exhort ye one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any of you bee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:177635:42"/> hardened through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Motiue hereunto may be the doubtfulnesse of life: For who knoweth when or how he may be called out of life? This is Christs argument;<note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 12.40.</note>
                  <hi>Be ye ready: for the Son of man commeth at an houre when ye thinke not.</hi> 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the longer a man liueth in sinne, his estate is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. For sinne by custome, gathereth strength, becommeth habituall, and in a manner natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Custome in it selfe is so effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious, as looke what things wee delight in in our life, wee thinke of when we are dying.<note n="*" place="margin">Prou. 22.6.</note>
                  <hi>Teach a childe in the trade of his way, and when he is old, hee shall not depart from it.</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Ierem. 13.23.</note>
                  <hi>Can the Blackmoore change his skinne? or the Leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to doe euill.</hi> 3. In the prorogation of thy repentance, thou doest heape vpon thy selfe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177635:42"/> the wrath of God, against the day of wrath. If a malefactor should bee enioyned euery day to carry a billet to the stake where he is to bee burned, for diuers yeares together, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth thereby great penance and misery. Now this is the condition of all such, as deferre their repentance. 4. The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger our conuersion is put off, the more Gods grace faileth, and the more the deuill preuaileth. For God for his part expresly telleth vs,<note n="a" place="margin">Prou. 1.24, 28, &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>Because I haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and yee refused: I haue stretched out my hand, and none would regard: then shall they call vpon me, but I will not answer: they shall seeke me early, but they shall not finde me.</hi> And this is equall retaliation of iustice,<note place="margin">Aug. Hac ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maduersione iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste percutitur peccator: vt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riens obliuiscatur sui, qui viuens oblitus est Dei.</note> according to that Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> speaketh, <hi>A sinner is iustly thus censured: to bee when hee is dying vnmindfull of himselfe, who, whilst he liued was vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177635:43"/> of God.</hi> Againe the Lord saith,<note n="b" place="margin">Ierem 51.9.</note>
                  <hi>we would haue cured Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, but she would not be healed: we therefore forsake her. On the other side the deuill, to whom it is meat, drinke, and pastime, to see men runne headlong into sinne,</hi> will freshly, and more fiercely set vpon vs. So as those of whom he could lay no hold of formerly in their life, now hee claspeth them in his armes by his temptations, when he espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them lying at the point of death. If therefore when wee are at our best strength, wee are vnable to resist the least temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; how shall wee in our doating and decreped estate, encounter the strongest? our aduersary being then stronger, and we weaker. Finally, a late repentance is scarce a due or true repentance,<note place="margin">Aug. sera paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, raro est se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria aut vera.</note> as <hi>Augustine</hi> obserueth. It is much to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, lest repentance it selfe dieth that proceedeth from a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177635:43"/> dying man; and he is serued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that is contemned of God at his death, who had contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned God formerly all the time of his life. To repent aright, is to leaue our sinnes, before our sinnes leaue vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Yea but may some say, the better theefe vpon the Crosse repented not before the last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed hee was not effectually called before the eleuenth houre, euen at the stroak of the twelfth. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his repentance was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and miraculous. And it was not without weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that Christ would not call him before the very nicke, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of his passion; namely, thereby luculently to expresse the power of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now we are not to make a common rule of a singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. It is therefore a fearfull fallacy to the enchantment of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177635:44"/> the soule, to feed vpon this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that if he hath but an eie to cast vp to heauen, and can but blurt out these words, <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon me,</hi> before he giueth vp the ghost, he may do well enough. This is all one, as if so bee a notorious theefe should say, I will all my life time rob and steale, and when I am at the gallowes, and ready to be turned ouer, will call vpon the Iudge for mercy, and so I shall be saued. He that will liue after this life, must lay the ground of his saluation in this life. For there be three degrees of life euerlasting. 1. The first is in this life, when being iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and sanctified, wee haue peace towards God and our Lord Iesus Christ. Some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there is no other life after this: But such deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; for it beginneth here,<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 5.24.</note>
                  <hi>Verily I say vnto you, he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth my word, and beleeueth in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177635:44"/> him that sent me, hath eternall life, and shall not enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but is passed from death vnto life.</hi> Wherefore the foundation of life euerlasting must be laid in this life, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by repentance, and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuouring to make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science assured, that God the father of our Lord Iesus Christ is become our father: that God the Sonne is become our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: that God the Holy Ghost is become our comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Nay we must goe further to say with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Galat. 2.20.</note>
                  <hi>I liue, not I, but Christ liueth in me.</hi> These are the seeds of eternall life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second degree is in the end of this life, when the body freed of all maladies and miseries, resteth quietly in his locker, and his soule returneth to God that gaue it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is after the last Iudgement, when the body and soule shall be consolidated,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177635:45"/> and reunited, and exalted to glory. Now hee that will take this first degree, must arise out of the Sepulcher of sinne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee hath lien all his life time hitherto. For to auoid the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death,</hi> a man must partake of the first resurrection:<note n="e" place="margin">Reuel. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.6.</note>
                  <hi>Blessed and holy is hee, that hath part in the first resurrection: For on such the second death hath no power. Paul</hi> telleth the <hi>Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Coloss. 1.13.</note>
                  <hi>that they were in this life deliuered from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and translated vnto the Kingdome of his deare Sonne.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> saith to the <hi>Iewes, The Kingdome of God is among you.</hi> This is the first degree of life, when a man may say with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Galat. 2.20.</note>
                  <hi>I liue not, but Christ liueth in me.</hi> That is to meane, I finde, by the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of a sanctified conscience within me, and partly by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Christ my Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by his holy Spirit leadeth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177635:45"/> and gouerneth, my thoughts, will, affections, and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and powers of body and minde, according to the rule of his holy will. Now that wee may say the like three graces of God are requisite in which this first degree of life consisteth. 1. The first is <hi>sauing knowledge,</hi> by which wee plentifully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selues, that God the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is our father, Christ the sonne is our redeemer, the holy Ghost is our comforter.<note n="h" place="margin">Ioh. 17.3.</note>
                  <hi>This is life eternal, (that is, it is the inchoati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and introduction into life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) to know thee the true God, and him whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ.</hi> 2. The second grace is,<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 14.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>
                  <hi>peace of conscience which passeth all vnderstanding.</hi> Hence is it that the Apostle saith, <hi>The Kingdome of God is righteousnesse, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost.</hi> The horror of a guilty conscience is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177635:46"/> of death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore the quiet of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science proceeding from the death of Christ, is life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse. 3. The third grace is the <hi>Regiment of the spirit,</hi> by which the heart, and life, is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to Gods word.</p>

                  <hi>Christ</hi> in his transfiguration on mount <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> conuented before him <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> that had beene dead long before, and with him <hi>Elias:</hi> to teach vs, that when wee are at the highest pitch of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to call death to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The memoriall of death is as fortunate a staffe to vs, while we walke this our pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of few and euill daies, as euer <hi>Iacobs</hi> was to him, in the way when he passed the foords
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177635:47"/> of <hi>Iordan.</hi> Looke we to the end, as the Easterne Sagers did to the starre, and it will conduct vs vnto Christ, as it did them. They that vnderstand the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to be at hand, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues readie all they may to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them: death our last enemie commeth fast vpon vs. Be we therefore warned, and so armed against him. Such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their Lords comming, come often to the side of the window, and looke out at the casement for him. So cast wee our eyes with holy <hi>Dauid</hi> to the heauens,<note n="o" place="margin">Psal 123 1.</note>
                  <hi>Ʋnto thee doe I lift vp mine eies, O thou that dwellest in the heauens.</hi> The life of a Christian is a meditation of death. <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> did build his Sepulchre &amp; Tombe in his life time, in the middest of his Garden. Which is exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto vs, in the middest of our merriments, to thinke of our monuments, and not to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177635:48"/> forget <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in our mirth. The heathen Phylosophers tooke a felicity in the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death, though void of the comfort of another life, that we looke for. For it doth vs good at the heart, to recognize the cause of our death, which is our sinne: together with the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thereof, the accursed death of Christ: cursed in respect of the inflicted punishment vpon our sinnes, but blessed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our selues. Euery one cā sufficiently remember an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offered him: but to many it is death, to remember death, so long as there is any bloud running in their veines, or marrow in their bones. There is none so old, but can well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the place wherein he hath laid vp his mony: but old and young can easily forget the place wherin their hiddē trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is.<note n="*" place="margin">Et viuunt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines tanquam mors nulla se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatur.</note>
                  <hi>We daily die, and are daily changed and yet we thinke our

We are as young chickens all the sort of vs, who when any of the brood is caught by the kite, the rest high in haste to the wings of the damme, some on one side, and some on the other, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their former feare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, doe meet and feed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and become a prey vnto the vulture. We may be sampled to the swine, who make a hoarse and hidious out-cry, but it is, but while one of them is vnder the butchers knife: and then immediately there is a deepe silence and all the din is done. Death hath laid his hand vpon thy father, thy wife, thy sonne, one of thy kindred, or allies, and wee weepe, and take on, and seeme to be in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull plight: but almost so
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177635:49"/> soone as the soule-bell ceaseth, the strength of our pang and passion is past. And as swine to the mire, and dogs to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they returne to their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed sinnes. As the defect of memory is a symptome and signe of a dying man; so the forgetfulnesse of death is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a man dying in his sins.

               <p>BEsides the precedent prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in generall, all our life long, a preparation in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is required to be made in the end of our life, when sicknesse and weaknesse do wait vpon vs. And this respecteth three sorts of duties: 1. Towards God. 2. Our selues. 3. Our neighbours.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That duty that hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto God only, is to take out our <hi>Quietus est</hi> from the Kings bench, to make our atonement and peace with God in Christ. All other offices are vnderlings to this: and all others in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of this, are nothing. This atonement is made by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newance of our former faith,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:177635:64"/> and repentance in this manner. Assoone as we feele our sicknes vpon vs, that we duly consider the originall thereof, how it came in, not casually, but by the hand of diuine prouidence. Next to that, we are to enquire after the cause, that gaue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction thereunto.</p>
               <p>For the first, euery mans state and fate is vnder diuine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and ordinance.<note place="margin">Stat sua cuique dies.</note> Euery man hath his day set him. So saith <hi>Syrach,</hi>

                  <hi>Are not his dayes determined? the number of his moneths are with thee: thou hast appointed his bounds which hee cannot passe.</hi> So saith <hi>Dauid,</hi>

On the other side, because that was the time wherein <hi>Iames</hi> must die, at that same time must hee bee put to the sword. <hi>Dauid</hi> came of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into great dangers vnder <hi>Saul</hi> and others: but because God had ordained him to life, he must escape them all.

                  <hi>Gather your selues, euen gather you, O nation, not worthy to bee loued.</hi> This examination and triall is to be made by the Commandements of the morall law. When a man entreth his house at midnight, he findeth or seeth nothing out of order: but let him come in the day time when the Sunne shineth, then hee shall espie many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, yea the very motes that flie about him: so if a man shall search his heart, in the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and darknes of his mind, he perceiueth nothing: but let
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177635:72"/> him search it by the light of the Law, and he shall see a number of sinnes without number, of which he will be sensible. But especially let vs make a suruay of our sins, by the tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which search the heart more narrowly than euer <hi>Laban</hi> did search <hi>Iacobs</hi> tent. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, and the meane of his conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For when he was a supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pharisee, in the glasse of this precept hee saw certaine sinnes, which without this hee had neuer discerned to bee sins.<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 7.7.13.</note>
                  <hi>I had not knowne lust, except the law had said, thou shalt not lust. But sinne tooke an occasion by the Commandement, and deceiued me, and slew me; that is to meane, humbled me.</hi> As concerning O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall sin, that is totally mine; the brests of <hi>Eue</hi> giuing no better milke vnto me. And <hi>Adam</hi> hath conueyed his whole nature vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, so as my father is an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morite,</hi>

The seeds of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sinne are in euery one, Christ only excepted, who was extraordinarily sanctified in his mothers wombe by the holy Ghost. As for our actuall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, in the examination thereof, we must obserue these three rules: 1. Not onely to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret out our palpable and grosse sinnes, but also to diue into the inward thoughts of the heart; for true repentance consisteth not onely in the alteration of thy words, attire, and outward actions, but also of the secret and hidden cogitations. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ioel</hi> calleth vpon the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Ioel. 2.13.</note>
                  <hi>To rend their hearts, and not their garments.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Ephes. 4.23.</note>
                  <hi>That they must bee renewed in the spirit of their minde.</hi> And <hi>Simon Peter</hi> adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Act. 8.22.</note>
                  <hi>to repent, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:177635:73"/> pray, if perhaps the thoughts of his heart may bee forgiuen him.</hi> 2. To consider the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our sinnes. 1. Time. 2. Place. 3. Maner, whether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly out of weaknesse, or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly through wilfulnesse, we haue committed these sinnes. 3. To runne ouer all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Commandements of the law morall, applying them as rules and directions to our hearts and liues, and so make long Registers of them, from our youth downeward. So shall wee come to the knowledge of our thrice miserable estate; that our sins exceed the haires of our head for number, and the sands of the sea for weight; and that they are a burthen too heauy for vs to beare. If after all this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thus made, we cannot sound the depth of our sins, (for what man doth know how oft he offendeth?)<note n="i" place="margin">Ierem. 17.9.</note>
                  <hi>For the heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue all

The Lord refuseth that beast for sacrifice, that cannot ruminate or chew the cud: so such as cannot chew the cud by confessing of sinnes, are no oblation for the Lords Altar.

               <p>MY next duty to God-ward, in my particular prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being now at the point to die, is to pray for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of my sins confessed.

And here I bethinke my selfe of the poore prisoner, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the barre, now ready to receiue the iudgement of death, crying out for mercy as for life &amp; death. And so I come to thee most righteous Iudge, and will neuer leaue to beseech thee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:177635:83"/> And hereupon <hi>Manasses</hi> freely acknowledged, that the Lord was God. But oh time! Oh maners! Oh men!

               <p>Now in case the sicke man be not able of himselfe, thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his prayers for his new sins, let him seeke for helpe of others;<note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 9.2.</note> as the palsie man had his potters to conuay him to Christ, bed and all. As touching
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:177635:83"/> the helpe requisite in this case, many duties must be performed. Whereof <hi>Iames</hi> deliuereth foure: two of them respecting the dying man, the two others assistants. 1. It shall more than behoue the dying man to send for helpe. And here wee take notice of two circumstances. 1. Whom we are to send for. 2. And when. 1. The parties to bee sent for, are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Church.<note n="p" place="margin">Iam. 5.14.</note>
                  <hi>Is any man sicke among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray ouer him.</hi> Neither is this office pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Minister alone, but it extendeth it selfe to all such likewise that haue the gift of prayer.<note n="q" place="margin">Hebr. 3.13.</note>
                  <hi>Exhort one another while it is called to day.</hi>

                  <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them that are disordered, and comfort those that are weake.</hi> But here comes in the custome of our times to be considered, and condemned, in the visiting
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:177635:84"/> of the sicke. Not a word of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or comfort haue they to minister to the sicke party: but they passe away the time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in silence, or in wandring speculation, or in vaine words nothing to the purpose; as, how doe you my good neighbour, I am sorry you are in this case, I hope you shall doe well againe, and that wee shall bee merry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine together, I will pray for you. But aske such a one how he will pray for him, and there he leaueth thee: for he hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a prayer at all. If hee can mumble, and say ouer the ten Commandements, and blurt out a <hi>Pater noster,</hi> meerely like a <hi>Parrot,</hi> without vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Now all this is long either of their ignorance of the Word, or that they thinke this to bee a businesse out of their element, nothing appertaining to their common wealth; but that this is the office of the Minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:177635:84"/> peculiar to his charge. 2. For the other circumstance of the <hi>Time</hi> when the sicke man is to deuote himselfe to prayer, I say, in the beginning of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: when the Preacher hath done, the Physitian should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; for the course quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary now taken, is preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and irreligious: for the Preacher to bee sent for, when hee is past physicke, and not himselfe. For vntill such time as remedy bee had for the surfet of the soule, and sinne the very root of all sicknesses and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be rooted vp, my Doctor of physicke with all his promises, and performances, shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme nothing: for health com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the highest, and is in Gods hand onely. But these times of ours haue altered the case, and turned it vpside down. The Physitian is thought vpon in the first place, and hee must bee sent for in all haste;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:177635:85"/> but the Preacher is neglected vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till death hath seized vpon the sicke man, and the bell begin to toll for him, as though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister could worke miracles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second duty of the <hi>Dying man,</hi> is to confesse his sinnes: an Argument wee haue dealt with before. Now the first duty in the <hi>Assistance</hi> to bee done, is to <hi>pray ouer him,</hi> that is, in his presence, with him, and for him, and by prayer to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the person himselfe and his estate to God.<note n="s" place="margin">2 King. 4.33.</note> So did <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi> on the behalfe of the <hi>Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> son raised from death to life, by the meanes of prayer.<note n="t" place="margin">Act. 20.10.</note> So did <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Eutychus.</hi>

Now for the better safeguard of his soule, hee is to arme &amp; fortifie himselfe against the feare of death. For howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer naturally, man feareth death all his life long, yet then more especially, when death is at the doore, and entring in vpon him. The childe of God is not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:177635:87"/> ouer-much to stand in feare of death. Hee is to feare it, and not to feare it: feare it hee must for two causes; 1. Because death is the enemy to life, the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of nature,<note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.26.</note>
                  <hi>The last enemy that shall bee destroyed:</hi> from which both man and beast doe flee. And it is the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God, plighted to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,<note n="u" place="margin">Reuel. 21.4.</note>

For thou hast deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mine eies from weeping, my feet from falling, my life from death: I will walke before God in the land of the liuing.</hi> In this case was <hi>Ezekias</hi> vpon the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of death he receiued,<note n="b" place="margin">Isai. 38.2.</note>

Nay Christ himselfe, in the foresaid respect, was not free of this feare, though it was without sinne; which he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where he said,<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 26.38.</note>
                  <hi>My soule

                  <hi>Were there not in death such a terrour, there could not be in the Martyrs such a valour,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine.</hi> Now for this cause that natures enemie, and the destroyer of it death, is to be feared: we are to feare it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and not otherwise than we feare sicknesse, pouerty, famine, with other griefes and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, which God will not haue vs to slight and despise, but to be sensible of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the scourges in Gods hand of sinne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sendeth paines and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with death, that they might be seared, and auoided, and wee therewithall learne in time to preuent sinne, the maine cause thereof. 2. Againe we may feare death, for the dammage imported both to Church and common-wealth, in the death of such, who while they liued, were the props and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:177635:89"/> pillars of them both. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we are not to feare death, but to be ioyous of it. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it freeth vs from the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of Sathan, from the bondage of sinne, the world, and condemnation; from the losses and crosses which this life is subiect to; and safely setteth vs vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Almighty, and as it were vnder the wings of our blessed Sauiour. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ by his death hath sweetned &amp; sanctified vnto vs both our death and graue. 3. Because <hi>Christ</hi> both in life &amp; death is aduantage;<note n="d" place="margin">Philip. 1.21.</note>
                  <hi>For to me, to liue in Christ, and to die, is gaine.</hi> 4. Because the comforts which the spirit of Christ ministreth to the soule, doe farre surpasse the sorrowes which death can bring with it. 5. The longing desire that wee ought to haue to behold the most glorious face of God, the company of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:177635:89"/> innumerable Angels, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of first-borne, and <hi>Iesus</hi> the Mediator of the new Testament, whose bloud spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth better things than the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> should make death a comfort, &amp; not a corsiue vnto vs. 6. In stead of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, wee shall be cloathed and garnished with glory. 7. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the sting of death, which is sinne, is plucked out, so as that fiery serpent the deuill can no more fasten it vpon vs; but we may boldly defie him, and bid him doe his worst, and triumph ouer him, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, in this wise;<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55.</note>

                  <hi>For as much as the children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of flesh and bloud, hee also himselfe likewise tooke part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: and deliuer them, who

Finally, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells are at hand to doe vs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice so soone as wee die, to take charge of our soules, and immediately to conuey them vp to heauen.

The due meditation hereof could make the heathen say, <hi>when it happeneth that it bee determined by God, that we should goe out of this life, wee ought cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obey; recounting how we are deliuered out of gaile, and translated out of darknesse into light.</hi> Well, as in most things saith <hi>Seneca, Death as it is, is commended as the best inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to nature: which whether it includeth felicity, or excludeth calamity, or determineth the tiresome wearisomenesse of the

                  </note>
                  <hi>Thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest rather be the more glad therefore, because in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, death it selfe is corrupted; the mortality is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, not the substance of the body.</hi> The same Father further prosecuteth this argument by way of the continued simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an Image thus: <hi>If any shall haue an Image eaten with rust and age, and in the greatest part consumed away, he break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and casteth it into the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, that by melting it he might
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:177635:91"/> giue it a new hue. Wherefore as an Image which is molten in a furnace, is not destroyed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued: so when our body dieth, it perisheth not, but is restored. Wherefore when thou shalt see an Image molten in the furnace, rest thou not in the speculation of this thing; but tarry a while vntill it be molten: neither yet art thou to content thy selfe in this, but further by a more through cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, thou must proceed. For the statuarie and craftsman of Images, when he casteth a body confected of brasse into a furnace, cannot make of the brasse a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and immortall Image.</hi> But verily God himselfe, of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and mortall body, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting it into the furnace, shall much more fashion it after a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den manner. So farre <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome.</hi> This is that the Apostle saith,<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.53.</note>

               <p>Now to this more masculine resolution to die without feare, I tender thee certaine <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Meditations</hi> to put thy selfe vpon. 1. For <hi>practice,</hi> That the <hi>Dying</hi> man doe not so
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:177635:92"/> much conferre his thoughts vpon death it selfe, as vpon the benefits that redound to him by death. Hee that is to passe ouer a broad and deepe Riuer, must not cast downe his eies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bottome; but to preuent feare, hee is to stand sure and to looke vpon the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the banke: so let the dying man set his eies vpon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the hauen and the keyes side, at which the ship of our soule must arriue; so shall he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Next the dying man is to behold the face of death in the glasse of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> not in the glasse of the <hi>moral law.</hi> For death by law is a curse and malediction, and the bottomelesse pit it selfe of destruction. But death through the Gospell, thanks bee giuen to God, is an introduction into eternall happinesse. The law sets downe death, as death: the Gospell sets downe death, not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:177635:93"/> as death, but as a sleepe only, because it speaketh of death, as it is changed by the death of Christ.</p>
               <p>Now the meditations I would giue thee be these; 1. Of the <hi>prouidence</hi> of God, which as it numbreth our haires, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth our daies; yea the very circumstances, as the <hi>Time, Place, Manner</hi> of our death, are foreseene, and soreordained.<note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 139.15, 16.</note>

                  <hi>The earthly tabernacle of the body, and house dawbed with clay:</hi> but to this end only, <hi>that wee might haue a building of God, an house not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens.</hi> If a King should command a begger to cast off his rags, and in the roome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to put on a royall robe, would he not gladly obey him? Now the King of Kings doth the same to vs, willing vs to put off the patcht garment of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which we receiued from <hi>Adam,</hi> to the end to be cloathed with the long white roabes laid vp in heauen for vs. 3.

                  </gap>r the condition of all such, whether they be liuing or dead, that be in Christ. He that dieth in faith towards Christ, dieth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177635:94"/> in Christ, and is really vnited and consolidated to Christ, both in soule and body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace. For death albeit it sundreth the body from the soule, yet none of them both are disioyned from Christ. The coniunction and vnion being made in this life, neuer to bee dissolued, remaineth for euer. 4. I muse vpon the speciall, happy, comfortable promise of Gods presence with such as are his, whether sicke, or ready to die, or any way afflicted. His word of promise is this, <hi>When thou goest thorow the water, thou shalt not bee drowned: or thorow the fire, thou shalt not be burned: For I am with thee.</hi> He is with vs, 1. Either by asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the extremitie of our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the pangs of death: and hence it is, that the paines of death to many are not so grieuous, as are the crosses of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:177635:94"/> this life: 2. Or else by cōforting vs by his free spirit, with ioyes that are not able to bee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And here we say with the holy Apostle,<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 5.3, 5.</note>
                  <hi>Wee reioyce in tribulation, because the loue of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the holy Ghost, which is giuen to vs.</hi> This ioy and gladnesse, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did heare of, which made his bones broken by great sicknesse to reioyce.<note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.5.</note>
                  <hi>As the sufferings of Christ abound in vs; so our consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aboundeth through Christ.</hi> Thus God sendeth a gracious raine vpon his inheritance, to refresh it when it is weary. And when mans helpe doth faile, Gods helpe doth preuaile, who in his owne person, at our bed side is present with vs in our sicknesse, yea maketh all our bed in our sicknesse. Now blessed be God, the Father of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who hath shewed vs such kindnesse
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:177635:95"/> in a strong City. 3. Or else by the ministery of his holy Angels, whom God hath made the <hi>kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> and <hi>nurses</hi> of his seruants, to stay vs, and to beare vs vp in their armes, as Nurses doe their sucking Infants: and to shield vs against Satan and his Angels, and against the power of all that hate vs. And this is seene espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the time of our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when his holy Angels pitch their tents round about vs, ready to conduct our soules to heauen, as they did the soule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome.</p>

                  <p>GIue grace O Lord that I may so liue, as I may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ashamed to liue, or loth to die. I know that death is fearefull to the naturall man: but I am thine by grace. And thou art present with me in my death-bed, to strengthen me in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:177635:95"/> my greatest weaknesse, and to compasse me about with songs of deliuerance. Wherefore though I walke thorow the middest of the vally and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, I will feare no euill; for thou art with mee, thy left hand is vnder my head, and thy right hand doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace mee. Why should I bee afraid in the daies of euill, or be disquieted within mee? For death is to mee an aduantage. I sigh and groane, desirous to be deliuered from this burden of the flesh, thereby to be made partaker of immortality, and to enioy those ioyes which thou thy selfe enioyest. My faith, O my God, hath scattered all feares: and my soule longeth for thy saluation. Deliuer my soule out of prison, and take me to thy mercy. Put an end to my sinnes, by the end of this life, that I may haue life without end.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Whether death may bee desired: and how?</head>
               <p>IT should seeme by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses, that death is rather to be desired than feared: and so I beleeue and teach; because I finde death described vnto mee in the scriptures, in such a milde manner, as I am weaned from my feare, and wonne to an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire of death. And I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue many weighty reasons, drawing that way; which by Gods grace now in my sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse I will hold mee vnto: which to thy comfort, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, I am content to recount vnto thee.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas it is the nature of death to destroy and spoile, death it selfe in the Elect is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and spoiled. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause death is nothing else but
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:177635:96"/> a passage to our fathers in peace; whereby is insinuated, that it is hard with vs here, where wee are no better than left to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and are in hucksters hands. God speaking of the death of <hi>Abraham,</hi> telleth him,<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 15.15.</note>
                  <hi>Thou shalt bee gathered to thy fathers.</hi> 3. Because death is no dispersion, but a collection of vs, to our owne people. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God saith to <hi>Moses,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating his death to him,<note n="q" place="margin">Num. 27.13.</note>
                  <hi>Thou shalt bee gathered vnto thy people:</hi> as though here wee were but scattered from the rest of the flocke; that so of the Elect, there might be as it were one liuing fold. 4. Because by death we are but said, <hi>to sleepe with our fathers.</hi> As where the Lord said to <hi>Moses,</hi>

First, death must be desired, so farre forth as it is a meanes to free vs from the corruption of our nature, from this miserable estate, in which almost, we doe nothing else but sinne and displease God. For this is the greatest griefe that can bee to Gods children by their sinnes to offend their so
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:177635:106"/> mercifull a father. As for such as are not sensible of the weight of their wickednesses, guiltinesse, and corruption, but bee slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring and snorting in their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they are therefore the more miserable, in that being plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the gulfe of all miseries, yet they feele no misery. 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as it is a meanes to bring vs to the immediate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Christ, and God himselfe in heauen. 3. Thirdly, death may lawfully bee desired, in respect of the troublesome miseries of this life, two cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being obserued. 1. That this desire bee not immoderate. 2. It must imply a submission and subiection to the will of God; where any of these bee wanting, the desire is faulty. It is a grieuous sinne to offer vnto God our impatience vnder the degree of prayer, as <hi>Ioab</hi> offered his treachery to <hi>Abner</hi> vnder pretence of a peaceable parley;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:177635:107"/> and as <hi>Iudas</hi> put his treason vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ vnder the colour of a kisse. Wherefore <hi>Iob, Ieremie, Ionas,</hi> failed herein; because they desired death out of their impatient minds. It is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon an vse, in forme of petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather of banning and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, to wish for death, yea, strange and accursed kindes of death, wherein God sheweth a iudgement: <hi>Let me sinke where I stand, let me neuer speake more;</hi> and euery crosse and vexation of life, maketh it irkesome and wearisome vnto vs, and to say, <hi>I would I were dead.</hi> If God should then take vs at our word, how deplorable and desperate were our case? But as old <hi>Chre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> in the Comedie, told <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topho</hi> his sonne, a young man, as much in discretion as in yeeres, who because hee could not wring ten pounds out of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fingers, to bestow vpon his loue <hi>Bacchis,</hi> he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:177635:107"/> liue no longer: but <hi>Emori cupio,</hi> was the eiaculation of my Gentleman. Whereas in this wise, wish not for death, before you bee ready for it: nay rather desire God to spare you a time, that you may recouer, I say not, your strength and bodily abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but his fauour and grace, before yee goe hence, and bee no more seene. The reason why the Apostle<note n="s" place="margin">Philip. 1.23.</note>
                  <hi>desired to bee dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and to be with Christ,</hi> which he said, <hi>was best of all:</hi> and the Saints that were racked,<note n="t" place="margin">Hebr. 11.25.</note>
                  <hi>cared not to bee deliuered, that they might obtaine a better resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> commend their crosses, as they were wont their dearest friends; that <hi>Ignatius</hi> called for fire and sword, &amp; for the teeth of wilde beasts: and other <hi>Martyrs</hi> of Christ went to their deaths, with reioycing and singing of Psalmes, and ran as cheerefully to the stake, as though they had
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:177635:108"/> a race to runne for a garland; we haue partly shewed from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer authorities, that they might be <hi>with Christ;</hi> &amp; that they might obtaine <hi>a better resurrection.</hi> But the speciall consideration hereof was this,<note n="n" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.2.</note>
                  <hi>Wee will not be vnclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,</hi> &amp; stript of our liues, we take no pleasure or ioy therein; but <hi>we would be cloathed vpon:</hi> wee haue no meanes to get that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cloathing, but by putting off this, or that vpon this, <hi>That mortality may bee swallowed vp of life, and corruption of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption.</hi> So that their thoughts subsist not in death, but haue a further reach, because they know it to bee the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way which bringeth vnto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse. And it is no slender per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion vnto them, when they thinke how by ending of their dayes, they make an end of sin: Wherefore they cry as he did, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:177635:112"/> to sauing faith: yet it is such, as for a time the dearest seruants of God are subiect vnto: as <hi>Dauid,</hi> where hee saith,<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 77.10.</note>
                  <hi>This is my death.</hi> As the incestuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> who was in hazzard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, of whose estate that way <hi>Paul</hi> was so tender, where hee aduiseth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> on his behalfe thus,<note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 2.7.</note>

Now we are to know that it is Gods wont, to worke by contraries; as in the creation, when all things were created, not of any preexistent matter, but of nothing, quite against the byas of nature. For of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nothing, can be made, as the schoole of <hi>Rationalists</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth;
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:177635:112"/> as in the worke of our Redemption where God giueth life, not by life but by death. And if wee consider aright of Christ vpon the Crosse, wee shall finde our Paradise, out of Paradise, euen in the middest of hell. For out of his owne cursed death doth he bring vs life, and eternall happinesse. As in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall vocation, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to conuert and turne men vnto him, he doth it by the meanes of the Gospell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, which in reason should driue all men from God. For it is as contrary to the nature of man, as fire is to water, and light to darknesse. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, when God will send his seruants to heauen, hee sendeth them a contrary way, euen by the gates of hell. And when it is his pleasure to make men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his fauour and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he makes them feele his anger. The loue of God is like
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:177635:113"/> a sea, into which when one is cast, he neither seeth bottome, nor feeleth banke. Wherefore I conclude, that <hi>Despaire</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer arising either of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of nature, or of conscience of sinne, though it happeneth about the time of death, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preiudge the saluation of them that are in the state of grace. As for other fearfull ends, they are often the fruits of violent diseases, which tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the body, and bereaue the minde of sense and reason. <hi>Rauings,</hi> and <hi>Blasphemings,</hi> are melancholicall fits and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which attend vpon bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning agues, the choler shooting vp to the braine. The distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lips, the turning of the necke, the buckling of the ioynts, are caused by cramps and conuulsions, the naturall effects of much euacuation. And whereas some in their sicknesse are of such strength,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:177635:113"/> as that three or foure men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold them downe without bonds; it comes not alwaies by witchery and possessions of euill spirits, as it is vulgarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but of choler in the veines. And whereas some when they are dead, turne as blacke as pitch (as <hi>Bonner</hi> did) it may arise by a bruise, or an Impostume, or by the blacke laundis, or by the putrefaction of the liuer: And it doth not alwayes argue an extraordinary Iudgement. Now these and the like diseases, with their symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and strange effects, though they may depriue a man of his health, and of the right vse of the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and of the vse of reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; yet they cannot depriue the soule of eternall life. And all sinnes procured by violent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and proceeding from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant sinners, are sinnes of infirmitie; for which if they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:177635:114"/> know them, and come againe to the vse of reason, they will further repent; if not, they are pardoned, and buried in the graue of Christ; and we are not so much to stand vpon the strangenesse of any mans end, when we know how well hee led his life. For his life, and not his death, must bee the rule and direction of our iudgement. And if this be true, that strange diseases, and thereupon strange behauiours in death, may befall the best man that is; wee must learne to rectifie the obliquity of our iudgement, of such at the point of death. The common conceit is, that if a man die qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and goe away like a lambe, (which in some diseases, as in consumptions, and such like, a man may doe) then hee goes strait to heauen. But if the violence of the disease stirreth vp impatience, and causeth franticke cariages, then they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:177635:114"/> passe their censure thus, It is the iudgement of God against him for his sinnes; and he was rightly so serued. But in very deed it is otherwise. For truly a man may die like a lambe, and yet goe to hell; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dying in most grieuous torments, and fearfull behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the body, may easily goe to heauen. Wherefore by the outward condition of any man, wee cannot calculate his condition before God.</p>

Fourthly, they vrge the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Gentiles, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this facinorous fact for fortitude; lauding their <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Cato,</hi> &amp; such others. But this was effeminatenesse and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and no manhood at all: for masculine courage passeth the pikes, and encountreth all extremities. <hi>Seneca,</hi> otherwise no ignoble author, would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise him that is deeply distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to make an end of himselfe; so to put an end to all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. But such counsell is no lesse dangerous than erroneous. Finally, they plead the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the ancient Church, which approueth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:177635:119"/> the disposition of such, who in defence of their chastity, haue chosen rather to foredoe themselues, than to bee defiled. <hi>Ambrose</hi> reporteth of the Lady <hi>Pelagia,</hi> that she, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her mother and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, did cast themselues head-long into a riuer; rather than the pursuing souldiers should violate them: and they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized in the <hi>Kalenders</hi> of the Martyrs of the Church. So <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> writeth of <hi>Sophronia,</hi> a noble woman of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Emperour <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius</hi> should fulfill his filthy lust vpon her, shee fell vpon a sword and died. But in such cases they should rather haue vnderstood, that it is no sinne to suffer vniustly; vnlesse the minde concurreth with the deed. Hereupon <hi>Augustine,</hi> among other things, disputing this question, and opening the very veine of the point it selfe,

               <p>Now followeth the manner of vsing the meanes; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which, three rules must
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:177635:124"/> be followed. 1. First, hee that is to enter vpon physicke, must not only prepare his body, as Physi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians doe prescribe; but he must also prepare his soule, by humbling himselfe vnder the mighty hand of God, in his sicknesse for his sinnes; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon God, by holy prayer, for the forgiuenesse of them, before any physicke come into his body. Now that this course is to bee taken, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth plainly in this; that sicknesses spring from our sinnes, as from a roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which should first of all bee stocked vp, that the branc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es might more easily die. And therefore <hi>Asa</hi> commended for many things else, is blamed for this by the holy Ghost.<note n="f" place="margin">2 Chron. 16.12.</note>
                  <hi>That hee sought not the Lord, but to Physitians, and put his trust in them.</hi> Oftentimes it comes to passe that diseases curable in themselues, are made incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:177635:125"/> by the sinnes and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the party; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the best way is, for them that would haue ease, when God beginnes to correct them by sicknesse, then also to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to humble themselues for all their sinnes, and to turne to God. 2. The second rule is, that when wee haue prepared our selues, and are about to vse physicke; wee must consecrate it by the word of God and prayer, as we doe our meat and drinke. For the word must bee our warrant, that the physicke prescribed is lawfull and good; and by prayer we must procure a blessing vpon it,<note n="g" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.3.</note>
                  <hi>For it is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the word of God, and prayer.</hi> 3. The third rule is, to consider aright, of the proper end and vse of Physicke; not to thinke that physicke can stop the course of nature, by way of preuention of sicknesse or death; but serueth to produce
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:177635:125"/> the life of man, to his naturall period.</p>

                  <hi>Lord how often shall my brother sinne against me, and I forgiue him? till seuen times?</hi> belike hee was loath to forgiue him eight times.

So did <hi>Isaac;</hi> and so did <hi>Iacob</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; in whose last Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, many worthy blessings were deliuered, and sundry sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular prophesies were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:177635:139"/> concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture estate of their children. So Christ vpon the Crosse had a prouident respect vnto his mother, commending her to the care of the disciple whom he loued. And truly it is a matter of great consequence, for a man to haue his Will by him, as the speciall meanes to preuent most tedious and costly sutes of law. And this is no indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as some suppose; who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that they would not haue their wealth discouered, or else because they would smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and suppresse their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, forbeare to make a Will.</p>
               <p>Now a Will is to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the lawes of nature, and the rules of Gods Word, and the good and wholesome lawes of the kingdome and place wherein they liue, and whereof they be members. But the Will of God must bee the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:177635:139"/> measuring Rod of the will of man. Therefore the Will which checketh any of these, is to be checked and reproued.</p>
               <p>These premisses considered, I haue no skill of such, who haue so profusely concocted their estate, as when they die, they haue not a dodrant left behinde them to bequeath. Yea, which is worse, they haue plunged themselues into such a depth of debt, as there is no get<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing out; to the remedilesse vndoing of their poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and orphans for euer. And they seeme to me no lesse strange, who are so gripple of the world, and are so wedded to the world, as to a wife, and they two are become one flesh; as it is a death to them to think of death, so long as they haue but a drop of bloud in their veines, or any little measure of marrow in their bones, though they be neuer so feeble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:177635:140"/> through age, as they die intestate, and so leaue their wiues and children to goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the eares, till the Lawyers haue licked vp all or the more part of their goods. Moreouer I am amazed in my muse at some, the very mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of humane nature, who hoord vp such monies in walls,<note place="margin">Cumuli tumuli.</note> in vaults and caues of the earth, places vnknowne to any but to themselues, which they haue wretchedly gathered together, so as they neuer come to good. These verily bewray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues what they are, as vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuoid of all conscience, as they be of affection of nature. Now by this testamentary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion of our goods, we make as it were a resignation of such things receiued from Gods hand, to the vse of this present life. And thereby we witnesse to the world, that we account the day of our death to bee at
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:177635:140"/> hand, and that we are to passe from the tiresome pilgrimage of the labours and sorrowes of this life, to our perpetuall rest; where no further vse is to bee had of this terrene and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pelfe and prouision that we make, to the wracke of our owne soules. And by this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and cheerefull resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the minde is prepared, and made ready to die, before death seizeth vpon vs. And so wee shake off these secular cares, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the viper from his hand, and bid the world fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well; &amp; so lay in time for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter estate in the world to come. Finally, by this meanes we cut off future brawles and broyles about questions of right, that none might intrude themselues into that which is anothers.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> That the sicke man in his will, is first to dispose of his soule, and to commend it to God.</head>
               <p>THe sicke man is monished in the person of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> to set his house in order. Now to performe this in order, hee must first bequeath his soule to God, his body to the ground, his goods to the right owners. The soule in the first place is to be considered of, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to God, as all other things that are most precious, in a full assurance that hee is able and willing to keepe them.<note n="x" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.12.</note>
                  <hi>I am not ashamed, for I know whom I haue beleeued: and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that hee is able to keepe that which I haue committed vnto him against that day.</hi> Thus the cause why he cōmitted his soule, saluation, and all to God,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:177635:142"/> was his faith in God that hee would safely keepe them. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth vpon all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to bee like minded;<note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.19.</note>
                  <hi>Let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their soules to him in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as vnto a faithfull Creator.</hi> As one friend when hee dieth committeth to another in trust the dispose of all his goods, as to a faithfull executor; so let euery Christian man make God his executor, who is faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it selfe. Thus Christ vpon the Crosse surrendred vp his soule into the hands of God:<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 23.46.</note>
                  <hi>Father into thy hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my spirit. And hauing said thus, he gaue vp the ghost.</hi> So did Saint <hi>Steuen,</hi> saying,<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 7.59.</note>
                  <hi>Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus receiue my spirit.</hi> And thus <hi>Dauid</hi> in danger of death, vsed the like language,<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 31.6.</note>
                  <hi>Into thy hands I commend my spirit; for thou hast redeemed mee, O Lord thou God of truth.</hi> The same we
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:177635:142"/> must doe. Now to doe this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, because it is difficult in it selfe, wee must fit our selues therunto, by vsing the meanes; 1. By duly considering, that God is the Creator of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all flesh, and so by way of necessary consequence, the preseruer of them: for the workman cannot but preserue the worke of his owne hands. No man is so carefull of any workmanship, as the Artificer and Craftsman himselfe. And shall not God bee much more carefull of the worke of his owne hands, than man can bee of his?<note n="e" place="margin">Psal 95.6, 7.</note>
                  <hi>O come let vs therefore worship, and fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: for he is the Lord our God, and we are the people of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and the sheepe of his hands.</hi> And this is the motiue to this duty, pressed by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> before mentioned;<note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.19.</note>

That wee vnquestionably perswade our selues, that God is our Father, that we are iustified, sanctified, and adopted by Christ. In which most holy faith, if wee shall edifie our selues, wee shall cheerefully commit our soules to his trust. For this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that put on Christ to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath his soule to God, for that he was his Father. 3. The continued experience wee haue of Gods loue, in the tender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of vs, is a principall spurre to pricke vs on in this way. So it was to <hi>Dauid,</hi> who hauing said,<note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 31.6.</note>
                  <hi>Into thy hands I commend my spirit;</hi> hee subioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the materiall motiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>for thou hast redeemed me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time to commend our soules to God is; 1. When any trouble or danger takes hold of vs. So did <hi>Dauid</hi> in the place before named, when through
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:177635:147"/> the snares that <hi>Saul</hi> laid for him, he was in perill of life, and had none whom hee might trust. As also in the time of a siege laid to a city; or in a combustion, at what time who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hath money, plate, iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, or any thing else of speciall worth, if he may haue time, hee will conuey them from the place. 2. But specially when we are ready to die; for then the soule is in the greatest hazzard; for that is the white that Satan aimeth at, with al the arrowes of his quiuer. 3. Yea all times are fit for this office; for at all times we ought to be in a readinesse, whē the Lord our God shall call; for at all times Satan lieth in the lurk for vs, admitting no truce. For we cannot be ignorant of his sleights. By so doing in the time of our best health, wee shall be more prompt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for this, at the time of our death. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour

                  <hi>And Dauid was in great sorrow; for the people intended to stone him: but Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid comforted himselfe in the Lord his God.</hi> And so it was <hi>Pauls;</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.12.</note>
                  <hi>I suffer these things, and am not ashamed, for I know whom I haue beleeued; and I am perswaded that he is able to keepe that which I haue committed vnto him, against that day.</hi> But how hath the God of this world blinded vs in this maine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our soules health? Wee daily commit our children to Tutors and Gouernours; if we haue flocks of sheepe, wee set keepers ouer them; but as though our soules could keepe themselues,<note place="margin">O curuae in terris animae, &amp; caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium inanes.</note> or had no need of any to keepe them in his waies, we let that alone for euer.</p>

                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:177635:152"/> were rightly augustious, that is, blessed words: <hi>Hee is no great man who thinkes it a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that trees and stones fall, and mortall men die. Iust art thou, O Lord, and righteous in thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Bernard</hi> in his last admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and farewell to his friends, perswaded them to ground the anchor of their faith on the safe and sure port of Gods mercy: and hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended three precepts to their imitation, which hee himselfe had practised. 1. Not to stand vpon the singularity of their owne reason and opinion. 2. Not to prosecute a reuenge of iniuries offered. 3. To offer harme to no man willingly; and for any harme done, to make amends in the best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that we may. The last words of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> hauing found that hee had receiued his deadly wound in the <hi>Heluetian</hi> wars, were few and forcible; <hi>They

His monition to the <hi>Ministers</hi> was, <hi>To maintaine the wholesome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, in purity and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity vnto the end; and to leade a quiet and peaceable life vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the world.</hi> 2. He contested for himselfe, that whereas hee was questioned, as a corrupter of the truth, he nothing regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded such scandalous imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but appealed from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill and vncourteous courts of their sinister conceits, to the high Commission Court of heauen, to the Iudge of all the world, whose iudgements are truth and righteousnesse alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And so hee cited the standers by, as witnesses of this his peremptory appellation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and confirming it with his last breath. 3. To his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:177635:153"/> he said, <hi>Loue God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And to his kinsfolkes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe, he spake further in this wise; <hi>I haue bound you with this contestation, you shall doe your endeuour that these my children may be godly, peaceable, and true.</hi> 4. To his friends that came to visit him, <hi>What shal I say vnto you? newes, I shall shortly be with Christ my Lord.</hi> 5. Finally, he rehearsed the whole fifty one Psalme, (the Psalme vsually among vs in our Assizes exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the malefactors for their necke-verse) and not without strong sighes, and a profound feeling of what he said. 6.

                  <hi>I haue fought a good fight; I haue kept the faith.</hi> Thus he would in no wise lay aside the shield of his faith; howsoeuer else, hee bare the marks of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> in his body. The faith of a Christian is alwaies in the field in skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes and sufferings, as Christ was in the garden in his agony and bloudy sweat, resisting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloud, yea vnto hell it selfe. Faith sometimes in the hearts of Gods seruants, is like the last sparke of a coale of fire going out; like the little graine of mustard seed, which the smaller birds deuoured; and like the last gaspe of a dying man; yet it recouereth it selfe, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth new strength.

                  <hi>Wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it not, for a blessing is in it.</hi> There be such Apoplexies of faith with men by fits, as if so be God should not take vs vp in his armes, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Eutychus,</hi> we might perish euerlastingly; we so faintly inwardly draw the breath of life, as it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceiued. In such an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie was <hi>Dauid,</hi> when for a whole yeares space hee wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mire, and puddle of his adultery without touch of breast. So was <hi>Peter</hi> in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie; and <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. He that neuer doubted of his saluation, neuer yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued. The true beleeuer fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth often and much fluctuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and wauerings; euen as a healthfull man feeleth grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:177635:159"/> and quaimes of an ague, and sicknesse, which he should not feele if he were not haile. I read of a man who said to Christ,<note n="g" place="margin">Mark 9.24.</note>
                  <hi>Lord I beleeue, helpe my vnbeleefe;</hi> which is all one, as to say, I beleeue, and I doe not beleeue. Therefore he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was a suppliant to Christ, to heale his sonnes infirmitie, is now as earnest a solicitor for himselfe, to heale his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity. How pittifully did <hi>Dauid</hi> plaine his case, when hee spake thus passionately?<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 77.7, 8, 9, 10.</note>
                  <hi>Will the Lord absent himselfe for euer? and will he be no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated? is his mercy cleane gone for euer? and is his promise come vtterly to an end for euermore? Hath God forgotten to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? and will hee shut vp his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnesse in displeasure?</hi> yea, he stoppeth not here, but proceedeth as if he were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration; <hi>I sayd this is my death.</hi> And this appeareth by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:177635:160"/> that he elsewhere saith, <hi>Why art thou so vexed, O my soule, and why art thou so disquited within me?</hi> Faith hath not onely her Spring time, and her Summer season, but also the fall of the leafe, and the winter. Many Christians are but as broken reedes, ouerthrowne by euery blast of wind; and but as smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie flax which hath fire in it, but so weake, as it neither can giue heat nor light, but smoke only. But as the Infant who as yet hath not the vse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is a reasonable creature; as he that is in a swound, and is not sensible of life, yet is not dead; so a Christian hath many quaimes creeping vpon his heart, and falleth often into a spirituall swound, and cannot perceiue at all any life of faith in him, and yet he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>Now I exhibit these salues vnto thee, for the cure of this

In <hi>Baptisme.</hi> 2. in his <hi>Supper.</hi> Why shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou therefore question the matter? By doubt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration thou dost as much displease God, as thou dost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most by any sinne else. Yea in <hi>Hieromes</hi> iudgement, <hi>Iudas</hi> his sinne of <hi>Desperation</hi> was more transcendent than the other his bloud-red sinne was of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against his Sauiour. And <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> rendreth vs the reason for it, because to sin hainously is the death of the soule, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, is to throw it hastily and headlong into hell. To despaire of Gods mercy, is to derogate from God in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: for thereby we turne his truth into a lie, and iustifie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan more than God; for God hath promised, sworne and set
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:177635:161"/> to his red wax, euen the bloud of his Sonne vnto it. Desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an immedicable maladie; for wee doe thereby as hee that hath a wound, and almost hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp, that thrusteth in his nailes, and maketh it as raw and rancke, and as grieuous as at the first. Desperation is the state and condition of the damned; for euery thing on earth liueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hope: for he that liueth, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in hope; and he that dieth, dieth in hope. Yea, the creature groaneth vnder hope, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for deliuerance in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the reuelation of the sonnes of God. Desperation is like the fourth beast mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> not named, but noted to be<note n="l" place="margin">Dan. 7.7.</note>

Nay, ye that are Lions in your owne houses, fiercer against your selues than others, behold the Lambe of God that taketh away the sins of the world. His death moued the boniest parts of the earth,

It is an Aphorisme worthy to be applauded by the double spirit of <hi>Elias, Why should I bee afraid in the dayes of euill, when iniquity compasseth mee at the beeles?</hi> Fortune may forsake an honest man, but faith and hope cannot: hee that is without hope, is without his best aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that should plead his cause.

                  <hi>He that can hope of nothing, let him despaire of nothing.</hi> Hope is as the showre of the second raine in the drought of summer. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negerus</hi> a noble gentleman, and a valiant man at armes among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in a fight at sea, when other meanes failed him, griped with his hands a ship of the enemies, to hold it to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; and when his hands were chopt off, hee tooke hold with his teeth, and would not let goe

So I will not by Gods grace giue ouer my hold of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion while I liue: No, though the Lord should kill me, (as <hi>Iob</hi> saith) I will put my trust in him. Wherefore, O my soule, say thou with <hi>Peter, It is good for me to be here:</hi> And with <hi>Dauid, My trust shall bee in the tender mercies of God for euer and euer.</hi> I will not so fall as the Elephant falleth, who when he is downe cannot rise againe.

First it is sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a life, and such a life as is eternall. 2. A glory, and a crowne of glory, and that of such a weight, as is not to be ballanced. 3. A king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and such a kingdome, as is not to be moued. 4. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and such an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as is immortall, vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and fades not away. Now tell mee, O man, what is that thy heart would haue? Is there any thing that thou esteemest aboue life? Is there any thing that may hold comparison with the life of glorie? Is there any greater glorie than a kingdome of glorie? Is there any surer kingdome than that which is thine, by the right of an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:177635:193"/> and permanent Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Now all these are thine in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> in the life to come.</p>
               <p>And here we take notice of the excellencie of that life that we shall haue, in that it shall be a life of glory. It shall not be therefore base or contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but the state thereof shall be euery way conspicuous and glorious. Wee may in some sort iudge of that glory, how glorious it shall bee, by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God manifested in his workes. If these workes of God which our eies behold, bee so glorious, what shall we thinke of those we see not? For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, among all the workes of God, those that are inuisible, are most excellent. The body of man is a beautifull worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, but it is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the soule. This <hi>Glory</hi> I account the highest degree of eternall life. The first is <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,</hi>

If our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>māce of the works of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bring such comfort to the minde, as the godly finde by experience; how shall our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort exceed, when wee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the reward of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Bernard. in Cant. serm. <hi>47.</hi> Si sic bonus es quaeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus te; qualis es assequentibus▪</note> which is <hi>glory?

               <p>And yet albeit wee cannot speake of it as wee should, let our mindes muse vpon it as they may.

                  <hi>And it is</hi> (faith <hi>Augustine) more easie to tell what that life is not, than to shew what it is.</hi> Yet certainely the Lord would neuer vse it as an Argument to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs in troubles, were it not, that it is his will that we should exercise our mindes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration thereof. When the Lord first promised to giue <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for inheritance, he commanded him to arise, and walke thorow the land to view the length and the bredth of it. And albeit he was not to giue him a present pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session thereof, yet the Lord
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:177635:195"/> would haue him to view it, that the sight of that which God had promised, might refresh and sustaine his soule, till the day wherein hee should possesse it, came. So we, though we bee not presently to enter pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of our heauenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet seeing the Lord hath so commanded vs, let vs now and then goe with <hi>Moses</hi> to the top of mount <hi>Pisgah,</hi> and view it: that is, let vs separate our selues from the earth, and ascend vp by prayer and spirituall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and solace our selues with some sight of that land, which it shall please the Lord one day to giue vnto vs. Now we see the Lord but thorow a veile, and in a mirrour; but then wee shall see him face to face, and shall in such sort behold his glory, as we shall be transformed into it. This change, as witnesseth the Apostle, is begun by the sight of God, which we haue in
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:177635:196"/> the Gospel. <hi>For euen now wee behold as in a mirrour, the glory of the Lord with open faith, and are changed from glory to glory, by the Image, by the Spirit of the Lord: but in heauen this change shall be perfected, and we shall be fully transformed into his similitude, so that nothing shall be left in vs, but that which is his workmanship.</hi> O Lord, how hast thou magnified thy mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs? Thou hast raised our honour from the dust, and deliuered our soules from the nethermost hell, and hast made vs to sit with thy selfe in the highest places, where wee shall bee filled with the ioyes which are at thy right hand, we shall drinke of the riuers of thy pleasures, in thy light wee shall see light, and bee transformed by the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>Moses</hi> was forty dayes with God vpon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and his face shined so bright, as
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:177635:196"/> when he descended, the people of <hi>Israel</hi> might not behold him. If those forty dayes remaining in the wildernesse with God, did so much alter him from the man hee was before; how shall we be altered, who shall for euer abide with him, and neuer any more come downe from him? Our face in that day, as our Siuiour Christ faith, <hi>shall shine as the Sunne in the firmament.</hi> O what glory shall be then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all, when the glory of one shall bee like the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Sunne!<note place="margin">August. ad Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres in eremo.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> were so rapt with ioy at the glance of his glory which they saw, as they would there haue fastened the cords of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remoued tabernacles, and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:177635:197"/> would there haue had their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode for a full doe; how then shall we be replenished with ioy when we shall see that full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of his glory? Wee shall couet no further remoue from that mountaine of the Lord. Another heart shall bee giuen vs, and wee shall become other men than we are. So that as a drop of water powred forth into a great vessell full of wine, loseth both the taste and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of water, and becommeth wine; or as the iron put into the fire, assumeth after a sort the nature of fire; and as the aire illuminated with the bright shining sun, seemes not so much to bee illuminated, as to be light it selfe; so our soules and bodies, when the glory of God shall shine vpon them, shall be so maruellously chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that after a sort they shall become partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature.</p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:177635:197"/>
               <p>Moreouer, the excellency of that glory shal better appeare, if we shal consider the companiōs with whom we shall be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is the congregation of the first-borne: all of them are men of excellent strength and dignity. None of them are of base linage, but of most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble descent. For by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth, they are the sonnes of God, and so coheires with Christ, and the brethren of our Lord Iesus Christ. The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Tyrus</hi> are described by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> to haue beene compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Princes; but in that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> euery Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen is a crowned King; and none but Kings are freemen of that City, knit among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by the bond of one spirit into so holy a communion, as euery one of them account the ioy and glory of his brethren an enlargement of his owne ioy and glory. It is otherwise there,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:177635:198"/> than here on earth, when the ioy of one is anothers sorrow. The light of the Sunne darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Moone, and the light of the Moone dimmes the light of the Starres; if the one halfe of the earth be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the other is left in darknes: but there the light of one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth the light of another; the glory of one shall be the glory of all; euery one of them reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, not onely because the lightsome countenance of God shineth vpon themselues; but also because they see their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren admitted to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the same glory.</p>
               <p>But among all those with whō wee shall be glorified, there is one companion of our glory, who aboue all the rest shall be the fulnesse of all ioy, euen Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the righteous. O with what boldnesse and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reioycing shall we stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the holy Angels, whē we
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:177635:198"/> shall see the Lord of the house, the Prince of glory, cloathed with our nature? Now we are sure that our Redeemer liueth, &amp; we shall at the last day see him in our flesh, wee our selues shall see him, &amp; our eyes shall behold him, and none ether for vs.</p>
               <p>Hence we learne to resolue a noble question, whether wee shall know one another in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? My answer is affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that we shall: my reasons are these; Our knowledge in heauen must farre exceed the knowledge of man on earth, when he was at his best in his estate of innocency. But <hi>Adam</hi> knew <hi>Euah,</hi> no sooner hee was awake, and not onely called her by her proper name, but also like a Diuine, sermoned of the indissoluble knot of marriage. And this may be one argument in the cause.<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 17.4.</note> When Christ was transfigured vpon mount <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, Peter</hi> knew <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:177635:199"/> whom he had neuer seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now, that transfiguration was an Idea &amp; resemblance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and vs, as the aptest for our apprehension of the future glory that remaineth for vs in heauen. And that is another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the cause.<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> The rich man that went to hel, knew <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> in heauen, in the bosome of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And this history <hi>Ambrose</hi> taketh to be a narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a thing done, &amp; not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked parable. But suppose it to be a parable, parables are of true things, and therefore the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is good. And this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument in the cause. Our knowledge there shall be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and perfect: wherefore I doubt not of this point. But whether we shall know one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as wee doe here, in an earthly manner; as to say, this was my father, and this my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, these my brethren and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; because the Scriptures say
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:177635:199"/> nothing thereunto, I hold my peace.</p>
               <p>Finally, the due regard of the place where we shall be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will further set forth vnto vs the excellency of that glory. As for the place, it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called a Paradice. So it is by our Sauiour, there being no meeter place in the earth to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow it, than was that garden of <hi>Eden</hi> named Paradice, the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place of man in his estate of innocency. Sometime hee calleth it <hi>his Fathers house, wherein are many mansions.</hi> Sometimes, <hi>the euerlasting ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations. S. Paul</hi> calleth it, <hi>the third heauen, an house not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens.</hi> Wee see in this frame and fabricke of the world, that the finest things are seated in the highest places. The earth as the grossest Creature is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the lower roome, the waters aboue the earth, the aire
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:177635:200"/> aboue the water, the fire aboue the aire, the spheres of heauen purer than any of them, aboue the rest, but the place of our glory is aboue them all, in the heauen of heauens, which doth not only note the excellent pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof, but sheweth also what principall purity is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all them that are to dwell therein.</p>
               <p>There be three places of the residence of the sonnes of God, in their three seuerall times. 1. Our mothers wombe. 2. The wombe of the earth, the mother of vs all. 3. The Palace of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is aboue. From the first, the Lord hath brought vs to the second; and from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, we rest in hope that the Lord when the fulnesse of time be come, will bring vs to the third. If we shall conferre these three together in their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of <hi>Time, Bounty, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> we shall finde the second not
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:177635:200"/> so farre to excell the first, as the third excells the second. The ordinary time of our abode in our mothers wombe is nine moneths; the time of our so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourning in our second house is much longer, threescore and ten twelue moneths; but in our third house, neither daies, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, nor yeares shall be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred vnto vs: for it is the place of our euerlasting habitation. To compare them in limits and latitude of place, we shall finde, that as the wombe of a woman is but of narrow dimensions, in regard of the spatiousnesse of the vniuerse: so this is nothing in comparison of that high Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, wherein are a number of mansions without number, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for many myriads of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect men and Angels. For if one starre be larger than the whole earth, what is the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, the continent of so many starres? And if the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:177635:201"/> be so wide, what shall we thinke of the heauen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, altogether boundlesse? Lastly, for <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> the inequality is exceeding great. When thou wert in thy mothers wombe, howsoeuer thy body was qualified with his faculties and senses, yet what sawest thou, or heardest thou there? Euery sense wanting the owne naturall obiect, could breed thee no delight. But this thy second house thou seest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with variety of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and pleasant things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery sense accompanied and stored with innumerable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects that may delight thee. And yet all the beauty and bounty of this earth is as farre inferiour to that which is aboue, as it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to that which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant had in the mothers womb. The firmament, which is the seeling of our second house, beautified with the Sunne,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:177635:201"/> Moone, and Starres, grauen in it by Gods owne hand, and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning more gloriously than all the pretious stones in the world, shall be no other thing than the nether side of the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Palace. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> sprang for ioy in the wombe of his mother <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> at the comming of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> into the house, in the wombe of his mother <hi>Mary.</hi> But afterward, when he saw the Lord Iesus more clearely face to face, and pointed him out by the finger, saying, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God, &amp;c.</hi> when hee stood by him as a friend, and heard the voice of the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, he reioyced in another manner. So in very truth, all the reioycing that wee haue in the house of our pilgrimage, is but like the springing of <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> in his mothers wombe, in comparison of those infinite ioyes wherewith wee shall be
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:177635:202"/> replenished, when wee shall meet with our Bridegroome in our Fathers house, wherein wee shall see him face to face, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with him for euer. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of <hi>Ahashuerus</hi> that hee made a sumptuous feast to his Princes and Nobles, which continued for the space of halfe a yeare; which being finished, he made another for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which lasted seuen daies. The place was the outmost Court of the Kings Palace, the hangings were of all colours, white, greene, blew, fastened with Ribbons of fine Linnen, and Purple, through Rings and Pillars of Siluer and Marble: the beds were of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, the pauement of Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Marble, Alablaster, and blew colour: the vessels wherein they dranke were all of gold. All this he did, that he might shew the glory of his kingdome, and the honour of his maiesty. If a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:177635:202"/> worme of the earth hath done so much in ostentatiō of his vain beggarly glory, as rauished men with the admiration thereof, how (I pray you) shall the Lord our God the great King declare his glory, when hee shall make his banquet couer his table, and gather his Princes, that is, his Sonnes thereunto, not for a few dayes, but for euer, not in the outmost Court, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court of his royall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace? Verily no tongue is able to expresse it. For seeing he hath decked the world wherin we so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne, and which I haue called the outmost Court of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, in so rich and glorious manner, that he hath ordained lights, both by day and night to shine in it, and hath prepared a storehouse of Fowles in the aire, another of Beasts in the earth, and the third of Fishes in the Sea, for our necessity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides innumerable pleasures for
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:177635:203"/> our delight. What glory and variety of pleasures may wee looke for, when he shall altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther separate vs from the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, and assemble vs all into the inward Court of his owne Palace, into the chamber of his presence? Now because, if wee would declare these things, they are more than wee are able to expresse, or thinke of, wee will rest and say with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Psal. 65.4.</note>
                  <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to come to thee: hee shall dwell in thy Courts, and be satisfied with the pleasures of thy house.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hauing thus scholied vpon the excellency of this glory, it is fit in the next place some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what should be said of the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> thereof. The state of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in heauen, and their glory there, is not subiect to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or alteration. This may appeare in that notable and stately description of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:177635:203"/>

                  <hi>It hath a great wall, and high, twelue gates, twelue Angels for Porters, and the wall had twelue foundations, of twelue forts of most excellent precious stones, and the wall it selfe was Iasper, and the city pure gold like crystall.</hi> The state of it is shadowed by precious stones, and gold, to signifie as well the durablenesse, as the excellencie thereof. For this cause <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth it,<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 15.1.</note>
                  <hi>The mountaine of Gods holinesse.</hi> Hils are hardly remoued, and therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> saith,<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 125.2.</note>
                  <hi>Mount Sion cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, but remaineth for euer.</hi> Now if that bee true of <hi>Mount Zion</hi> in this world, which must needs bee taken either <hi>literally,</hi> for the state of the visible Church, which cannot be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowne; or <hi>mystically,</hi> for the state of Gods grace, which in this world cannot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and finally be lost: I say; if
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:177635:204"/> this <hi>mount Zion</hi> standeth fast, and cannot be remoued: how much more true is it of the state of glory in heauen, and of the triumphant Church, and of heauenly <hi>Zion,</hi> that is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, so durable, so vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable that it cannot be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but standeth fast for euer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the state of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in heauen, is not onely sure, but <hi>euerlasting,</hi> that is, without end.<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 37.18.</note>
                  <hi>The inheritance of holy men is perpetuall.</hi> Therefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance reserued in heauen for vs,<note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4.</note>
                  <hi>is immortall, and not fading away.</hi> It fades not away, there is the vnchangeablenesse: It is immortall, there is the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. Where wee learne the great difference betwixt the state of that world, and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world wherein wee liue in the body. For what is there in this world so excellent, so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:177635:204"/> so costly, so artificiall, but is subiect both to <hi>alteration,</hi> and in the end to <hi>dissolution?</hi> The longest day hath his night, and the longest life endeth in death, after many miseries and maladies: the longest Empires, and mightiest Monarchies had their stop and period after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mutations: the stateliest and strongest Cities ended in ruine after many ciuill broiles, massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, and other miseries. Though a man had all the earth for his kingdome, yet it could not be a kingdome of eternity. No Prince euer reigned the whole age of a man, and so long time as a man naturally may liue, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> the Philosophers say, is the space of an hundred yeeres. But our kingdome in heauen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures not only the age of a man, but for euer and euer. <hi>Iezabel</hi> had a glorious kingdome, but within a few yeeres it was said

                  <hi>Where is that Iezabel?</hi> When it was fulfilled which the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> foretold;<note n="g" place="margin">Ierem. 13.28.</note>
                  <hi>Tell the King and Queene, humble your selues, for your dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity shall bee taken away, and the crowne of your glory shall fall downe.</hi> And the like is the greatnesse of all earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, so that no glory, no strength, no happinesse, nothing at all is there in this world, that is either constant or perpetuall, but subiect to vtter dissolution in the end, and in the meane time, to ruthfull alterations. So weake a foundation hath this world, and the best things in it. But contrariwise the glory of heauen hath such a foundation, as is both vnchangeable and eternall. This is our hope, and the perfection of our desires, and therefore as the <hi>Creed</hi> hath his period in <hi>life euerlasting;</hi> so the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> endeth in

                  <hi>They shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament, and they that turne many to righteousnesse, shall shine as the starres for euer and euer.</hi> But the brightnes of the firmament is farre exceeded by that of the starres.

There is a fulnesse of ioy for him that shall haue least, that shall be but a doore-keeper in the Lords house.

                  <p>O Lord, manifold are those thy mercies that thou hast laid vp in store for them that feare thy Name, the least of them is greater than I can vtter. Draw me after thee, and I will runne after the sauour of thy sweet ointments, and my bones which thou hast broken shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce. O how doth my soule long to be with the Saints in glory! While I haue any being I will seeke thy glory, that I may bee made partaker of thy glory, and sing with all Saints, <hi>Glory be to thee, O Lord, most high.</hi> The light afflictions of this life, hold no proportion with that exceeding weight of glory in the life to come. I cheerefully therefore for this glories sake, beare all the shame, reproach, afflictions of this present life,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:177635:218"/> for the attainement of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall glory. I am thine, O saue me, take away from me the shame that is mine, which hath couered my face; and giue mee the glory which is thine, when I shall see thy face in thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For thine is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the power, and glory, for euer and for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </gap> of this doctrine of eternall life.</head>
               <p>THe due consideration of our eternall life, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs variety of good lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As so to vse the world, as though we vsed it not; as liuing in expectation of a better world. The Pilgrims mind is alwaies set
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:177635:218"/> vpon his iourneys end, &amp; he is grieued when as at any time he is out of the way: so fix we our thoughts vpon our long home, and let vs be disquieted not a little vpon euery by-way, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning a diuersion from the Kings high way. <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called out of <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> &amp; from his own kindred, &amp; his fathers house, to a strange place, was straight wayes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the heauenly Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and by faith dwelt in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth country, and as one dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in tents. But the principall spurre that pricked him on so speedily, was the expectation of life eternall.<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 11.8.</note>
                  <hi>For he looked for a City whose builder and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is God.</hi> We are not therefore to bathe our selues in the liquid and languide pleasures of this world. Pilgrims take but small pleasure in their iourneyes, as
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:177635:219"/> considering they are not at home. This is <hi>Peters</hi> argument,<note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.11.</note>
                  <hi>Dearely beloued, as strangers and pilgrims, abstaine from fleshly lusts, which fight against the soule.</hi> We are not to be carried away, no not with the necessary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and delights this world can afford vs. For the Pilgrim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> passing thorow a strange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, regardeth not the goods and commodities of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where he is, but making vse onely of such things as may serue his present necessity, hee calleth his thoughts home to his owne countrey. This minde should bee in vs, amidst all our pleasures and prosperity this world can yeeld vs: wee are to weane our thoughts from it, and spend all our cares vpon that countrey where our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation is to be.<note n="o" place="margin">Colos. 3.20.</note>
                  <hi>But our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation is in heauen, whence we looke for our Sauiour Iesus Christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:177635:219"/> this is the Apostles exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But worldly men make their belly their God; that is, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelme themselues with these secular sensualities so far, as they thinke not of any other life, neither is God in all their thoughts. Wee are to vse the world no otherwise than the traueller doth his walking staffe, and the ferry-man his oares, who lay them aside when their iourney is at an end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This point, as I may so terme it, is a <hi>schoole-house of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> in the time of affliction, for iudgement often beginneth at Gods house. The mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to weane her childe, layeth mustard, wormewood, or some such bitter thing, to her breasts, that the childe by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste, may loath and leaue the brest: so the Lord by our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, doth mortifie our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and doth weane and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:177635:220"/> win vs from the loue of this world. As al rawflesh is offensiue to the stomacke, so is euery sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Gods stomack, vntill such time as God by afflictions doth mortifie our affections in the corruptions thereof, especially this of the loue of this life. Hope of heauen begets patience, and contentment in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of life: wherefore the Disciples disquieted at Christs departure from them, he heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them with these words of comfort;<note n="p" place="margin">1 Ioh. 14.2.</note>
                  <hi>In my Fathers house are glorious mansions, I goe to prepare a place for you.</hi> Hence many may perceiue, how they deceiue themselues, while they prate and boast of heauen, and presume enough thereof: and yet can concoct and digest no wrong, but they are ready to mutter betweene the teeth, to blaspheme the name of God, and to prosecute euery one that
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:177635:220"/> harme them, in all spleneticall and vindicatiue maner. Againe, in case the Lord shall lay an heauy hand vpon them, they runne to wizzards and witches, the Deuils factiue instruments &amp; right hand as I may so terme them; and so runne to very hell it selfe for helpe. These and all such doe but flatter and beguile themselues, for if they would fit themselues, for heauen, they would runne contrary courses; for questionlesse that man is carelesse, hap to him what hap may in this present life, who looketh for heauen at Gods hand after this life. Let our mindes be grounded in the assured expectation of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and the yoke of affliction shall bee easie vnto vs, and the burthen light. Example hereof wee haue in <hi>Moses,</hi> whom the Apostle celebrating for his faith, saith,<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 11.24.</note>
                  <hi>By faith Moses
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:177635:221"/> when hee was come to age, chose rather to suffer aduersity with the people of God, than to enioy the pleasures of sin for a season, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the rebuke of Christ grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riches, than the treasures of Aegypt. For he had respect vnto the recompence of the reward.</hi> When God shal giue vs a whole bowle full of afflictions, and bid vs drinke all out to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, the meditation of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall is as it were sugar to sweeten the bowle, and to make it taste pleasantly and strongly like to <hi>Aqua vitae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, whereas there is a life to come after this, but not for all, but for the elect onely, it shall stand vs in hand to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour all wee may, that wee may bee found worthy to bee inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors thereof: by first seeking the kingdome of grace here, that there wee may attaine to the kingdome of glory, euen by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:177635:221"/> Christ</hi> who hath so dearly bought vs, &amp; purchased vs with his bloud; to whom all blessing, praise and power be ascribed for euer.</p>
               <div type="collect">
                  <head>The Collect.</head>
                  <p>O Lord and heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who hast taken vs out of the kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and hast giuen vs a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which shall haue no end: wee giue thee praise and glory. And we pray thee giue vs grace to minde and seeke this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome aboue all, and to count all other things no better than dung in comparison of this. And preserue and fit vs for this life to come, by giuing vs the grace to die to sinne daily, and daily to liue to all new obedience: that while I liue, I may liue by faith in the Sonne of God, who hath loued mee, and giuen himselfe for mee. And thus in this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:177635:222"/> of this life eternall, which thou hast prepared for mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds, and thy Sonne Christ since hath purchased for me in the world, and to which by the spirit of sanctification, I am scaled: I goe to thee, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Father of the spirits of all flesh, leauing my body to the earth from whence it came, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of the resurrection of all flesh, and in the meane while commend my soule to thee; O thou that gauest it me, receiue it againe of me, and bundle it vp in the bundle of life. Goe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O thou my soule, to thy Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier: flie as a bird vnto the hill, free of all sorrow &amp; sin, to be partaker of those ioyes thou thy selfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyest.

And so with this new song in my mouth, euen a thanksgiuing vnto my God, I pluck vp my feer, and giue vp the ghost.</p>
